# Bearcat Study Tables
Bearcat Study Tables is a mobile application that allows you to join a real-time chat room / discussion board for the section or class you are taking. It will integrate with the the Canopy system and all students will have an account through their 6+2 / password. The idea behind the app is that it is an alternative to the discussion boards built into Blackboard - you will be able to send and receive messages in real time and ask questions and share example problems, code attachments, etc. It can be utilized by UC staff and professors to help students and uphold academic integrity. The application could also be used to check out study rooms for groups or schedule meetings with other students/professor similarly to WebEx. We hope to add the ability to have formatted equation/code input and if time permits add features such as screen-sharing and video recording.
